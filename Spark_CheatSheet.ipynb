        "   - Joins with skewed keys (>5% data in single key)\n",
        "   - Heavy aggregations on hot keys\n",
        "   - Tasks taking 3x+ longer than median\n",
        "2. Salt Range Selection:\n",
        "   - Small datasets: 5-10 salts\n",
        "   - Medium datasets: 10-50 salts\n",
        "   - Large datasets: 50-100 salts\n",
        "   - Rule: sqrt(num_executors) * 2\n",
        "3. Trade-offs:\n",
        "   - Pros: Better parallelism, prevents OOM\n",
        "   - Cons: Extra shuffle, increased data size\n",
        "4. Alternatives to Consider:\n",
        "   - Broadcast joins (for small tables)\n",
        "   - Bucketing (for repeated joins)\n",
        "   - Repartitioning with custom partitioner\n",
        "   - AQE (Adaptive Query Execution) in Spark 3.0+\n",
        "5. Monitoring:\n",
        "   - Use Spark UI to identify stragglers\n",
        "   - Check partition sizes in shuffle\n",
